# Fractionless Boilerplate v3.0.0b

> A front-end boilerplate and CSS starting point you build up instead of tear down.

Most HTML boilerplates and CSS frameworks give you way too much to start off with. You end up spending a lot of time tearing them apart before you can become productive and start building your project up and out. Fractionless aims to solve that problem by giving you a good, blank, starting point you can build up and out from.
